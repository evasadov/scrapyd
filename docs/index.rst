Scrapyd
=======

Scrapyd is an application for deploying and running Scrapy spiders. It
enables you to deploy (upload) your projects and control their spiders using a
JSON API.

.. warning::

    This documentation is for the old |version| version of scrapyd.
    Unless you are maintaining an old project that requires it,
    you may instead want the
    `latest version <http://scrapyd.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.
